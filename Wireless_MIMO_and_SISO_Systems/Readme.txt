DESCRIPTIONS:

SISO:

1) The 'mod' variable in the 6th line of the MATLAB code in the SISO file should 
be selected as one of the 8QAM, 16QAM, 64QAM, QPSK, BPSK modulation techniques.
2) The 'Channel_mode' variable in line 48 of the same MATLAB code should 
be selected as one of the 'Rayleigh Channel' or 'Rician Channel' channels.

MEAN MIMO:

1) The 'mod' variable in the 6th line of the 'MIMO_2x2_BER_Mean' MATLAB code in the 
MIMO file should be selected as one of the 8QAM, 16QAM, 64QAM, QPSK, BPSK modulation techniques.
2) The 'Channel_mode' variable in line 56 of the same MATLAB code should 
be selected as one of the 'Rayleigh' or 'Rician' channels.

MULTIPLEXING MIMO
1) The 'mod' variable in the 6th line of the 'MIMO_2x2_Data_Multiplex' MATLAB code in the 
MIMO file should be selected as one of the 8QAM, 16QAM, 64QAM, QPSK, BPSK modulation techniques.
2) The 'Channel_mode' variable in line 65 of the same MATLAB code should
